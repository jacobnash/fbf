"""
Device-credential encryption at rest. Plaintext JSON is fine for a webhook
HMAC secret (see timberdoodle/webhooks.py) - it's a shared signing key sent
over HTTPS to an operator-chosen URL. It's the wrong bar for a real device
login a human types in, so this stores the password with Fernet (AES-128 +
HMAC, the standard boring choice for "encrypt a small blob with one
symmetric key") rather than plaintext. Not a vault/KMS integration - that's
over-engineering for this project's single-trusted-operator, localhost
deployment; a key in an env var matches how every other secret here
(POSTGRES_PASSWORD, etc.) is already handled.
