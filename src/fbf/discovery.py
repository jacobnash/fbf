BACnet device/point discovery - the "Discover" and "Learn" halves of the
SkySpark-style flow (point at a network, find devices; point at a device,
find its points), so nothing downstream ever needs a hand-typed object
identifier. Real BACnet client calls via bacpypes3's Application, no
protocol code of our own.
