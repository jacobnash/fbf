"""
Connection persistence - the one genuinely new piece FBF needed for this
feature (no config file or DB existed anywhere in this project before).
A JSON file, not sqlite3: every write already funnels through a single
asyncio loop thread (see connection_manager.py), so there's no
concurrent-writer problem for sqlite3's transactions to solve, and the
payload (a device address, a poll interval, and a list of point dicts) has
no schema advantage over "a list of dicts, in a file."

Known, accepted gap: no file locking - single process per state file is an
assumption, not enforced. Fine per YAGNI unless multi-process is actually
needed.
