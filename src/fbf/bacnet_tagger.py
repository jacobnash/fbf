"""
Untagged BACnet driver metadata -> Haystack marker tags, with no Xeto/
Fantom/Axon toolchain involved. Same subset-match, most-specific-wins
algorithm as timberdoodle's mapping.classify_point (rules/haystack_to_brick.yaml
there) - here it runs one stage earlier, over tokens pulled from a learned
point's label/object_identifier/description instead of over Haystack tags.
The output is the exact tag dict shape haystack_bridge.py already publishes
over MQTT (f"{prefix}/{label}/tags"), so mqtt_listener.py -> ingest_tags ->
mapping.classify_point on the Timberdoodle side needs zero changes to
consume it - it's already generic over "wherever a /tags message came from".

ponytail: token matching only (label/object_identifier/description) - units
("degrees-fahrenheit" etc.) isn't tokenized into the match set, since turning
a raw unit string into a useful signal needs a synonym table
(fahrenheit/celsius -> temp, "%rh" -> humidity) this doesn't build yet. Add
one if label/description alone turn out to under-match on real hardware.
