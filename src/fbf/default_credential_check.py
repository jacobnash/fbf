"""
Best-effort check for a discovered device still sitting on a factory-default
login - meant to catch equipment left unconfigured during commissioning, not
a general credential-cracking tool.

Neither BACnet nor Modbus has a login of its own (confirmed against both
protocol client libraries: Who-Is/I-Am and register reads are unauthenticated
by design) - so "default credentials" can only mean a discovered device's own
HTTP admin UI, the concrete case this feature was asked for (a gateway's
local web login). That's why this takes a bare host, not a protocol - it's
the same check regardless of whether the host came from a BACnet or a Modbus
discovery pass.

Deliberately narrow: HTTP Basic Auth only, GET only, a short hardcoded
default list, and it only ever runs against a host that already came out of
an authorized discovery scan - it has no other input, so it can't reach
anything the operator didn't already point discovery at. Known, accepted
gap: misses form-based admin logins, which are more common in real gateway
firmware than HTTP Basic Auth - catching those needs per-vendor login-form
knowledge, out of scope for this basic check.
