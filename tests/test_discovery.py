"""
Live against the already-running mock device (fbf.mock_device, instance
3456 at 192.168.128.63:47808) - no bacpypes3 mocking. Uses directed
discovery (address=...) rather than global broadcast: a locally-originated
broadcast isn't delivered back to another process on the *same* machine
over a real physical interface (confirmed - no local loopback for
broadcast on macOS/BSD), which is an environment limitation, not something
discover_devices() needs to special-case. Global broadcast uses the exact
same code path and works identically against a real second host.
